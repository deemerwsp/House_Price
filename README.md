### Conclusions and Recommendations

Based on our analysis, the key features that indicate the Sale Price of a house are listed in the dictionary created above. Measurements of Sq Ft for Living Area, Basement, and Garage are key features to gauge a houses value. Other features that considerably affect the value are assessed deductions in house functionality, neighborhood, year built, kitchen quality, garage capacity, living quarters in basement, central air, fireplace, extra rooms, proximity to desirable areas, land contours, and electrical configurations. These factors can be interpreted and aid in appraises the value of houses.
